This repo is all about my website clone task.
I chose to clone instagram website.
Here is my instagram clone using html and css.
working on this, made me understand the depth of learning basic concept and few tags and attribute.
I really learnt alot, working on styling the website using css.
The experience that i gained out of this will surely help me with my future projects.
